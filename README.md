## [MEaSUREs_GMSL_v5_demo.ipynb](MEaSUREs_GMSL_v5_demo.ipynb)

This notebook pertains to the Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) trend generated from the Integrated Multi-Mission Ocean Altimeter Data for Climate Research Version 5. Access the dataset on the PO.DAAC web portal:    
https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/MERGED_TP_J1_OSTM_OST_GMSL_ASCII_V5

You will learn how to 1) download the ASCII table, 2) load to a *pandas* data frame, 3) plot with *matplotlib*, and 4) write to CF-compliant netCDF4.

Requirements: Python 3; *pandas*, *matplotlib*, and *xarray* + the netCDF4 library (if you want to write a netCDF file at the end)
